# Tic Tackity Toe

This is my final assignment for the Web Programming 2 course.

It's a multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game built with **React**, **Redux**, and **Socket.IO**, featuring:

- Nickname-based login
- Live dashboard with user and match tracking
- Challenge and accept matches
- Real-time gameplay with turn-based logic
- Persistent sessions with reconnect support

Frontend built from scratch. Server code was provided with the assignment.
